# Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553
This repository contains code from the take-home portions of Mechatronics with Prof. Dan Block at UIUC. The take-home projects worked with the MSP430G2553 microcontroller which students soldered contacts for on a PCB to connect it to various sensors and outputs. Course content available at http://coecsl.ece.illinois.edu/ge423/ although this link gets updated each semester.  
  
Please do not steal the code if you are currently in the course, there is no guarentee that any of it is correct or up to date.  

## Content
Each project is fairly small and contained in its own folder. The folder will contain a video of the project working if one is available from when I was taking the course. Unless otherwise specified, the only file I worked in will be named <code>user_<em>folderName</em>.c</code> where <em>folderName</em> is the name of the folder it is found under. A skeleton of that file and all the other files are initialized by running the executable <code>G2553ProjCreator.exe</code> under the folder <code>G2553ProjCreator</code>, which was provided by the course.  
  
* [chasingLEDs](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/chasingLEDs/user_chasingLEDs.c): Introduces bit manipulation, the timer function, and UART in C to make 4 LEDs chase each other back and forth  
* [getSwitchState](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/getSwitchState/user_getSwitchState.c): Focuses on inputs and space conservation by using char's (as opposed to ints) to label the current state of 2 buttons and use LEDs to indicate the state  
* [readPotWithADC](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/readPotWithADC/user_readPotWithADC.c): Starts working with setting up the ADC to read data, in this case the voltage going through a potentiometer  
* [readPhotoresistorWithADC](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/readPhotoresistorWithADC/user_readPhotoresistorWithADC.c): Establishes the importance of tuning sensors to the environment they will be functioning in by controlling LEDs based on if the lights in the room are on or off (as indicated by a photoresistor)  
* [ctrlLEDwTerminal](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/ctrlLEDwTerminal/user_ctrlLEDwTerminal.c): Typing certain characters into the terminal turns corresponding LEDs on while characters outside the accepted range turn all LEDs off  
* [poorMansDAC](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/poorMansDAC/user_poorMansDAC.c): Samples the photoresistor and echos its value to the DAC using SPI  
* [toggleServoMotorPos](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/toggleServoMotorPos/user_toggleServoMotorPos.c): Uses PWM duty cycles to toggle the position of two servo motors  
* [debounceButtons](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/debounceButtons/user_debounceButtons.c): Disables button interrupt for a short time after initial interrupt to prevent the illusion of multiple button taps when only one tap occurred ([video](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/debounceButtons/debounced%20buttons.mp4)). Also toggles LED when either button is pressed ([video](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/debounceButtons/toggle%20LED%20when%20either%20button%20pressed.mp4))  
* [sampleADCwithDTC](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/sampleADCwithDTC/user_sampleADCwithDTC.c): Samples several non-consecutive ADC channels with the help of the ADC's Data Transfer Controller, converts the values to mV, and prints the values to the terminal. Also blinks an LED. ([video](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/sampleADCwithDTC/workingDemo.mp4))  
* [usingTimerCapture](https://github.com/monk200/Mechatronics_with_MSP430G2553/blob/main/usingTimerCapture/user_usingTimerCapture.c): Uses the Capture functionality of TimerA1 to display the period and time that TimerA1 is high to the terminal  

## Setup
All the code done in this class was edited and debugged using Code Composer Studio and a terminal emulator such as Tera Term or PuTTY. The terminal emulator of choice needs to be set to communicate with the COM port that the MSP430 is plugged into via USB cable and to be communicating at 115200 bits/second. The COM port can by determined by searching through your computer's Device Manager. Once this is set up and the code is open in Code Composer, build the project by clicking the hammer icon in the toolbar or clicking <code>ctrl+b</code>. The program will flash the microcontroller and once it does, the green play button at the top can be pressed to start running the code.
